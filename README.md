# dsss-qpsk-modulation
Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) realisation using Quadrature Phase Shift Key (QPSK) modulation.

Direct-sequence spread spectrum technique primarily used to reduce overall signal interference. The direct-sequence modulation makes the transmitted signal wider in bandwidth than the information bandwidth. After the dispreading or removal of the direct sequence modulation in the receiver, the information bandwidth is restored, while the unintentional and intentional interference is substantially reduced.


• In some communication system applications, we have some concerns that outweigh bandwidth efficiency.

• Mostly in wireless applications, stations must be able to share this medium without interception by an eavesdropper and without being subject to jamming from a malicious intruder to achieve these goals. Spread spectrum techniques add redundancy.

• The usage of spread spectrum techniques adds a strong layer of security for the transmission of information signals without the worry of them getting intercepted in between. This results in a much greater bandwidth than the signal would have if its frequency were not varied.

• One such technique provides efficient transmission over large distances by varying the sequence of the information signal pattern.
